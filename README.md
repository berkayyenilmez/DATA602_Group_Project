# Crime Through the Years: Unveiling Trends and Patterns (2017-Present)

## Project Topic
This project utilizes both the "Crime Incidents February 2017 to 5th July 2023" dataset and the "Crime Incidents July 2023 to Present" dataset to analyze long-term trends and patterns in crime across Prince George's County. By examining a wide variety of crime types, including traffic accidents, assaults, burglaries, and homicides, the project seeks to identify key changes in public safety over time. With advanced analytical methods and geographic visualizations, the project aims to uncover crime hotspots, investigate temporal trends, and provide insights into the social dynamics and safety challenges of the community over the years.
